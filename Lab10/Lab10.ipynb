    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore SQL queries using a database of video game sales we downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faisaljanjua0555/eda-video-games-sales). This database is simple. There's only one table. Each row of the table is a single video game. The columns in this database include the name of the game, the platform (console,) the year the game was published, the genre of the game, the game's publisher, and the sales for North America, Europe, Japan, other places, and total global sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, the name of this table is `vgsale`. The names of the columns are as follows: `Name`,`Platform`,`Year`,`Genre`, `Publisher`, `NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, `JP_Sales`, `Other_Sales`, and `Global_Sales`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important caveate for this lab before we get started. This database is incomplete. The queries we make against it won't necessarily give us the absolute truth. Our queries can only answer queries about the games included in this database, so those answers might not be comprehensive.\n",
